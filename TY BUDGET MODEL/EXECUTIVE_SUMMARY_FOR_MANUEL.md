## Key Recommendations

### 1. Payout Ratio is the #1 Priority
- Current: 200% → Target: 45-50%
- New risk management solution is critical
- Every 10% reduction = €10k saved per €100k revenue

### 2. Fix Paid Ads Before Scaling
- Current ROAS: 0.61x (losing €0.39 per €1 spent)
- Target ROAS: 1.5x minimum
- Fix attribution, creative, targeting FIRST

### 3. Double Down on Free Channels
- Expand affiliate program
- Invest in content/SEO
- Build email list aggressively (highest ARPU)

### 4. Funding Ask
- **Minimum:** €1M (survival mode)
- **Recommended:** €2M (growth runway)
- **Aggressive:** €5M (market capture)

### 5. Path to €100k/month Revenue
- Requires 4x growth from current €25k
- At 20% monthly growth: ~8 months (September 2026)
- At 15% monthly growth: ~10 months (November 2026)

### 6. Key Milestones
- WooCommerce + Futures launch: January 12, 2026
- Ingmar meeting: March 2026 (Florida)
- Target breakeven: Q4 2026 (with funding)

## Summary for Ingmar

**The Ask:** €2M additional funding

4. At 20% monthly growth, we hit €100k by Sept 2026

**Key Levers:**
1. Reduce payout ratio from 200% to 50%
2. Optimize paid ads (ROAS 0.61x → 1.5x)

4. New risk management = lower payouts

**ROI on Investment:**
- €2M investment
- Year 1 revenue: ~€990k
